# Technology Term Extractor Web App Using Streamlit and Deployed with Docker on Azure

The web app is here: https://tech-detector.azurewebsites.net/

The app can help you extract distinct technology terms from text. There are 3 options.

* Option 1 (under 450 words): Enter a url. The app will return the scraped text from the url and the technology terms in the text.
* Option 2 (under 450 words): Enter some text. The app will return the input text and the technology terms in the text.
* Option 3 (for multiple articles and over 450 words): Upload a file with one column named "text". The app will return a csv file with the input articles and the detected technology terms for each article. You can download the returned file.
